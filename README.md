# Entering_USACO_Code_CPP
Program submissions require simple Header comments: your ID (i.e., your USACO login name), the name of the program (which will be given in each programming assignment, and the language used. See the examples below to get the idea.

Every training page problem has input and output. Currently, the input appears in a file named 'probname.in' (e.g., if the problem name is 'ride', then the input filename is 'ride.in'). Output must be written to a file named 'probname.out' (i.e., 'ride.out' for the 'ride' problem).


The simplest programming challenge is named 'test' and requires you to read a pair of small integers from a single input line in the file 'test.in' and print their sum to the file 'test.out'.  Below is a simple solution in the 'C' programming language. Note the use of 'exit (0);', which is usually required to exit properly.


You can try as many different things (subject to the caveats below) as you like to see how the grading system works. Theoretically, you can't break it or crash it. If you see a problem, please let me know.

The restrictions are few:

One second runtime limit unless other specified (programs are run on a modern processor but times are scaled to a 700 MHz Pentium III)
About 16MB datasize limit
About 1MB stacksize limit
Be sure your program exits with status 0
Be sure you print complete lines (with terminating newline), not just a few words or numbers
Don't use files other than the specified input, output, and auxiliary files
Other common sense rules that need not be listed
The rules are simple:

Don't try to cheat.
Don't just print the answers, you must calculate them in your program. If you just print answers, your login ID might be removed.
Don't try to look at other files on the system or use other schemes to break security
Don't try to break common sense rules of privacy
Please report anomalous behavior to me right away (<rob.kolstad@gmail.com>)
Have as much fun as possible
Earn a trip to the IOI and other exotic contests!
